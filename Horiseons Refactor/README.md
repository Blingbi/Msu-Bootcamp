# Horesion Code Refactor
This is a code refactor of the horiseon website. Fixed some CSS issues that cause issues with horizontal monitors and cleaned it up a bit. 
Reformated the index file to follow procedure using specific designations for each section. Added alts for each  image for accesibility 
purposes. Commented all the code so everything is clearly documented, thanks - Konner
